# Riot-API-Client
This Client is used to have an elemental base to stand and build on. It is currently under work, and I'm still improving it day by day, so make sure you keep up-to-date!

#** EDIT:
This is obsolete. I will not furtherly work on this as of 23th of May 2016. The reason is due to the way of approaching specific things could be done better.
